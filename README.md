# Sea-Surface-Temperature
Exponential smoothing is a time series forecasting method that applies weighted averages of past observations to make predictions. When used for sea surface temperature (SST) prediction, exponential smoothing helps to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends in temperature data.
